Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Vitor Linhalis, and this is where I showcase my projects, skills, and professional experience for 2025.
## About Me

### Professional Background
After a decade of convincing computers to do things they don't want to do, I've mastered the art of arguing with Swift compilers and occasionally winning. I've dabbled in enough programming languages to know that they're all frustrating in their own special ways, but Swift and I have developed a particularly dysfunctional codependent relationship that somehow produces functional software.

## International Experience
In 2017, I traded São Paulo's charming combination of traffic jams and existential dread for the Netherlands' delightfully passive-aggressive politeness and an alarming number of bicycles. This cultural whiplash has taught me that no matter where you go, people are fundamentally the same: they want their apps to work, and they want them yesterday. My "global perspective" mostly consists of knowing how to complain about code in Portuguese, English, and broken Dutch.

## Progressive Mindset
I'm one of those insufferable developers who actually thinks technology should help people instead of just extracting their data for profit. I know, revolutionary stuff. I believe in building inclusive software, probably because I've spent enough time being excluded from things myself to know it sucks. My approach to problem-solving involves asking uncomfortable questions like "Wait, are we actually solving a real problem or just creating a more efficient way to waste people's time?"

## Seeking a Positive Work Environment
I've done my time in the corporate trenches, sitting through meetings about meetings and watching perfectly good ideas die in committees. Now I'm looking for a smaller company where "synergy" isn't overused and where my individual contributions won't disappear into the bureaucratic void like tears in rain. Basically, I want to work somewhere that treats developers like humans instead of glorified code monkeys, where "work-life balance" isn't just something they put on the careers page to attract candidates, and where innovation means more than just adding AI to everything because it's trendy.
