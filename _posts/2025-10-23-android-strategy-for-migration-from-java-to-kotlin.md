Gradual Migration Approach
- Start with new features in Kotlin
- Convert utility classes and data models first
- Migrate UI components gradually
- Keep complex business logic in Java initially
- Convert remaining code once team is comfortable

Risk Mitigation
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage
- Use Kotlin's Java interop during transition
- Train team on Kotlin best practices
- Consider using automated conversion tools as starting point (but review carefully)
- Apply MVVM architecture all over the codebase.
